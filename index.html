        Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures 
        and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic 
        typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application 
        development in many areas on most platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for 
        all major platforms from the Python Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a>, and may be freely distributed. The 
        same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs 
        and tools, and additional documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable 
        as an extension language for customizable applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy 
        for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

    <header>Invoking the Interpreter</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        The Python interpreter is usually installed as 
        /usr/local/bin/python3.9 on those machines where it is available; 
        putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it 
        possible to start it by typing the command:.
      </p>

      <code>
        python3.9
      </code>

      <p>
        to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter 
        lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with 
        your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python 
        is a popular alternative location.).
      </p>

      <p>
        On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, 
        the python3.9 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, 
        you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other 
        ways to launch Python.
      </p>

        command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt 
        causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit 
        the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().
      </p>

      <p>
        The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and 
        code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check 
        to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python 
        prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input 
        Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to 
        happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to 
        use backspace to remove characters from the current line.
      </p>

      <p>
        The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected 
        to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name 
        argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.
      </p>

    </article>

  <section class="main-section" id="Argument_Passing">
    <header>Argument Passing</header>
    <article>

      <p>
        When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into 
        a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list 
        by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments 
        are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard 
        input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m 
        module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c 
        command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in 
        sys.argv for the command or module to handle.
      </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Interactive_Mode">
    <header>Interactive Mode</header>
    <p>
      When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it 
      prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for 
      continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter 
      prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the 
      first prompt:
    </p>

    <code>
      $ python3.9
      Python 3.9 (default, June 4 2019, 09:25:04)
      [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
      >>>
    </code>

    <p>
      Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look 
      at this if statement:
    </p>

    <code>
      >>> the_world_is_flat = True
      >>> if the_world_is_flat:
      ...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
      ...
      Be careful not to fall off!
    </code>
    <p>

        Will be three actions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          declare an encoding.
        </li>
        <li>
          declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
        </li>
        <li>
          declare that Windows-1252 encoding.
        </li>
        
      </ul>
      
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Source_Code_Encoding">
    <header>Source Code Encoding</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In 
        that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used 
        simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although 
        the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a 
        convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these 
        characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is 
        UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in 
        the file.
      </p>

      <p>
        To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment 
        line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as 
        follows:
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
      <p>
        This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
        ECMAScript 2015.
      </p>

      <code> # -*- coding: encoding -*-</code>

      <p>
        where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the 
        first line of your source code file should be:
      </p>

      <code>
        # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
      </code>

      <p>
        One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with 
        a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should 
        be added as the second line of the file. For example:
      </p>

      <code>
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
      </code>
